# Subminer

Small game about a submarine harvesting valuable minerals, fighting enemies and avoiding dangerous obstacles. This project is a product of my need to learn more about Godot and GDScript and level design in general. And even though it's serves as my playground to try new things, in the end the priority is to have something that is fun  to play. Hopefully the project will serve as a learning tool for others as well.

These are the main things/features that I have implemeted or am planning to implement:

* Free movent in four axes with free aim while shooting.
* Overheating weapon if firing for too long. Short cooldown is needed to be able to shoot again.
* Flexible level system which will allow me to add/remove levels as needed with ease.
* Support for various translations. Will be supporting Czech and English languages but it will be possible to easily add more.
* User friendly level designer with the help of TileMaps and creating objects instances with the use of specific tiles in a TileSet.
* Various enemies and obstacles with different behaviours and with some degree of customizations.
* Simple dialog system which will allow to show continuous text before every level (with support for translations of course).
* Basic main menu with "How To Play" screen and pause screen during gameplay.
* Boss enemy in the last level with behaviour patterns.
* Open level design which will allow player to finish it have he/she seem fit.
* Some kind of audio service (with use of autoload) which will allow to easily play sounds from every node without the need to insert AudioPlayer to every scene.

Made in Godot 3.4.x.
